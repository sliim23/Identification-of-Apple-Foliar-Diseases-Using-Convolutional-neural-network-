# Identification-of-Apple-Foliar-Diseases-Using-Convolutional-neural-network-
This paper proposes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of apple foliar diseases from leaf images.
Apple orchids are under constant threats from several pathogens and insect attacks. Early detection and appropriate deployment of disease management can help to counteract these threats. Delayed diagnosis can lead to decreased production, increased production costs, excessive or inadequate use of chemicals, and environmental health impacts.
